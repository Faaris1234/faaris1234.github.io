		<h1>Movies and Film Making</h1>
		<p>I really enjoy watching films and understanding the process of making them.</p>
		<p>I have cultivated this interest throughout the years, but have recently hit my stride with it.</p>
		<p>I find that watching the finished product and understanding the process of making said product, is extremely fascinating and adds to the overall experience of watching films.</p>

		<h2>Film Making</h2>
		<p>I have spent a lot of time studying different film making techniques such as cinematogrophy and editing.</p>
		<p>These elements are key to the process of making striking and memorable films.</p>
		<p>Some of the people I like to study when it comes to film making include: Christopher Nolan, Denis Villeneuve, and David Fincher.</p>

		<h2>My Favorite Movies</h2>
		<p>While I watch almost every movie that comes out, I still have a couple of favorites that I always come back to. These currently include, but are not limited to: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Dark Knight</li>
			<li>Zodiac</li>
			<li>12 Angry Men</li>
			<li>The Social Network</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To me, each of these films is endlessly rewatchable. I always find myself appreciating something new anytime I watch them and being engrossed by every element.</p>

		<h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
		<p>Many of my friends share my interest in film and we have ventured out to make a couple of short films.</p>
		<p>I always have a lot of fun making these shorts and find that it is a good way to stay engaged with my friends.</p>
		<p>I hope to continue this practice while elevating the quality of work for each short film we create!</p>
