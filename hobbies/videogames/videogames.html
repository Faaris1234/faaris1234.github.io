		<h1>Video Games</h1>
		<p>I frequently play video games to both unwind after a long day and challenge myself mentally.</p>
		<p>I also use video games to stay connected with friends that I cannot meet physically. They serve as the backdrop for friendly interactions and good times.</p>
		
		<h2>My Favorite Games</h2>
		<p>While I enjoy a wide variety of different games, there are some that see a lot more play time than others. These include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>League of Legends</li>
			<li>Batman: Arkham Knight</li>
			<li>Fortnite</li>
			<li>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Side Note</h3>
		<p>Please feel free to search my League of Legends account on <a href="https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/Darth%20Chungus-NA1">op.gg</a>!</p>

		<h2>Single-Player Games</h2>
		<p>I tend to play single player games when I want to challenge myself. Many single player games like Elden Ring are puposefully designed to engage you at every level and then challenge you through difficulty, puzzles, and combat.</p>
		<p>I seek these games out when I've had a slow day and want to really engage myself for a couple of hours.</p>
		<p>As I have grown older, I find that I don't seek these types of games out as much as I used to. However, I still make the time to play any new releases.</p>

		<h2>Mult-Player Games</h2>
		<p>I like to play multi player games exclusively with my grounp of friends. These types of game serve as a good background activity while we catch up and hang out.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, these types of games also test our ability to work together as a team, while leading to a lot of funny hijinks.</p>
		<p>I tend to mostly play multi player games in my free to stay connected with my friends. I really enjoy the fact that these types of games give us an easy way to hangout no matter where we are in the world.</p>
