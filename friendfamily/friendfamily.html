		<h1>My Friends and Family</h1>
		
		<h2>My Friends</h2>
		<p>I have a close group of friends that I have known since Elementary School. We regularly hang out, play video games, and have fun together.</p>
		<p>We've experienced a lot of different things together, but I always look back upon our trip to Los Angeles and Disneyland fondly!</p>
