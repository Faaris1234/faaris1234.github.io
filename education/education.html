		<h1>My Education</h1>
        <p>I have attended a couple of different schools throughout my life. Most of them have been enjoyable, but they each presented challenges.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><h2>Mission Valley Elementary</h2></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>I attended Mission Valley from Kindergarten to 6th grade. Here, I began my educational journey while making lifelong friends!</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><h2 id="hop">Hopkins Junior High School</h2></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>I attend Hopkins from 7th grade to 8th grade. At Hopkins I started developing my interest in Computer Science and started to focus on classes related to it.</p>
                <p>The most fun I had at Hopkins was my 8th grade band field trip to Disney Land!</p>
            </dd>
            

            <dt><h2>Mission San Jose High School</h2></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>I attended MSJ from 9th grade to 12th grade. MSJ was by far the most difficult school I have attended, including college.</p>
                <p>I focused a lot on extracurricular activities, clubs, and volunteering. I also had to study a lot for AP tests and the SAT. Overall, high school lead to a decrease in fun and an increase in rigour.</p>
                <p>I graduated during the COVID-19 pandemic, so my senior year of high school was all online!</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><h2 id="wisc">University of Wisconsin-Madison</h2></dt>
            <dd>
                <p>I am currently in my last semester here at UW Madison. I have really enjoyed all of my classes and learned a lot from them, while living alone.</p>
                <p>I have developed a lot as an individual in these last four years and will fondly look back at my time spent here.</p>
            </dd>
